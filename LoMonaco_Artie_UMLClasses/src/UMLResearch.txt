Research:
Instance Methods require objects of the class to be created before 
it can be called on, whereas Static Methods can be called without 
creating an instance of its class. 

The word static after an access modifier (e.g. private or public)
when creating a class makes it a Static Method. Otherwise, it is an 
Instance Method.

Instance:
public void myMethod() { }

Static:
public static void myMethod() { }
